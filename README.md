The project entitled as “CRYPTOGRAPHY USING 
PYTHON” is secured application.
 It is the analysis of mathematical methods which is in 
connection with the information safety such as data integrity, 
authentication and data origination
 It is an Encryption and Decryption application which will be 
developed using python and is used to encrypt any type of file based 
on AES Standards and the files that are encrypted using this script can 
also able to decrypt it.We can encrypt and decrypt any type of file 
using this application.
